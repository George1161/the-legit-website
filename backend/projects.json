    "fullDescription": "The Legit Project is a creative movement and digital platform built to highlight and support authentic people doing real things — from artists and small business owners to hobbyists and startup founders.\r\n\r\nWe run interactive public challenges called Legit Quests, where people solve meme-based riddles, follow stylized maps, or recreate scenes from edited photos hidden around the city. These challenges are open to anyone and are designed to be fun, clever, and reward-driven — with real cash prizes and public recognition.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the quests, The Legit also runs a biweekly donation program where we give $100 to support a person or project that stands out for being original, useful, or bold. Submissions are open to the public — anyone can apply and share what they're working on. Winners are chosen based on authenticity, creativity, and potential impact.\r\n\r\nThe platform blends modern meme culture, street energy, and a touch of fantasy aesthetic — with QR codes, digital clues, and raw, honest storytelling at its core. We keep things simple, mysterious, and community-driven. No spam. No cringe. Just legit.",
